# HydraTool_CyberSecurity
Hydra password testing  
This project demonstrates the use of Hydra, a widely-used password-cracking tool, to simulate brute-force attacks for cybersecurity testing. The goal is to identify weak passwords and understand the importance of strong authentication mechanisms in real-world systems.

Hydra automates login attempts across multiple protocols such as SSH, HTTP, and FTP using a predefined list of usernames and passwords. This project emphasizes ethical testing on authorized systems only.

**Features**
Automated password testing for multiple users and protocols.
Highlights weak or guessable passwords.
Demonstrates the importance of password security and multi-factor authentication.
Provides logs of successful and failed login attempts.

**Usage**

Open Hydra in PowerShell or terminal.
**Use a command like:**
_hydra -l username -P passlist.txt ssh://127.0.0.1_

-l specifies the username
-P specifies the password list
ssh://127.0.0.1 is the target protocol and host
